In this project, a power control circuit was designed for use in microwave ovens, allowing the control of the magnetron's output power. This circuit spends less energy and has a reduced size in relation to traditional ferroresonant power supplies. The control of the output power is done through a plant that is feedbacked by a temperature sensor. The plant consists in a firmware solution that is integrated to a high power control circuit, which does the switching of the inverter connected to the primary winding of a high power transformer, that in turn has the magnetron connected to it’s secondary winding. Controlling the duty cycle makes the control of the magnetron output power possible. The firmware solution and the control circuit consist in a single, small sized unit, that can be integrated to a conventional microwave oven.\\
